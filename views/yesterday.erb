        <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
        my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p>

        He has shown the strength of his arm,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br>
        He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
        He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
        He has come to the help of his servant Israel,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
