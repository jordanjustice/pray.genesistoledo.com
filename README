#Common Prayer
##Genesis Christian Fellowship
We all have rhythms, routines and rituals. Whether it's getting up in the morning and turning on the coffee pot, or reading a book before bed, routine has a way of forming and shaping us.

As a community we long to be shaped and formed in the same direction. One of the ways we pursue this is through praying together. Morning, midday & evening.

Inspired by historic and more recent prayer movements in the church we have developed a simple set of prayers to guide our days and recalibrate our lives around the way of Christ and the mission of his bride, the Church.
